I'm a recent graduate from hunter college. I have a bachelors in computer science with a minor in math. I'm currently working with TipTop technologies as
a software engineer. I'm currently working on a passion project as well called csphere to help people stay ontop of their bookmarks and have them 
actually revisit them rather then pilling them up. I gym, run, like to explore coffee chops around nyc. Kinda of a coffee adict so if you lvoe coffee we'll get along just fine.
My inetrest align in development and ai as I've always been fascinated by ai when I was growing up. I'm open to any jobs within the tech sector and would love to 
have a quick chat to see if a potential role aligns with my career intrests. For now I'm just going with the flow, making myself 1 percent better day by day until I become the
engineer that I know I can become. Some of my favorite shows include one piece, suits, and any drama show ou can imagine.
